pseudocode 
input:all names of students
output: split array with 5 names in each array
steps:
get all names into an array
call array and apply the each_slice method and use the coder block to write how you want to print out ur arrays

What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
	The most difficult part of this challenge was getting every student name inside an array.And the most interesting part was how I got to write the problem in two lines of code.
Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
	I do feel like im improving in my pseudocode because it breaks down the challenge into steps that are easy to follow.
Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
		My approach in automating I think was pretty good because I used a method to make it run the way I wanted
What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
	I Iterated a mehod to the the array and in the coder block had it print out the way I wanted it to.
What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
	My initial solution was already refactored becaue i used a refactored method.
