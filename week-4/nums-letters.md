  <h2>How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?</h2>
    <p>Ruby handles the math like if it was a basic calculator. </p>
  <h2>What is the difference between integers and floats?</h2>
    <p>integers are numbers without a decimal in it and floats are numbers with with decimals in it.  </p>
  <h2>What is the difference between integer and float division?</h2>
  <p> when you divide an integers it doesn't give you a decimal for example if
  if you divide 9/2 your answer is going to be 8 with no remainder. And a float
  division does give you a decimal using the same example if you divide 9/2 it
  will get 4.5 and as in integer you only got 4. </p>
  <h2>What are strings? Why and when would you use them?</h2>
  <p>Strings are a group or a just a word are inside parentheses that
  can printed to the console. You would use this for when you want to substitute in a variable like for example you can make a word equal a string and when ever you want to use that string you only have to type in the word instead of the whole string.  </p>
  <h2>What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?</h2>
  <p>A local variable is a variable that is only visible inside the method. You would use these variables when you have a method and have one or more variables and you need to use on of the variables. </p>
  <h2>How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?</h2>
  <p>this challenge was pretty basic and I did get good review with some of the ruby basics. </p>
