// Refactored Code






// Reflection
//What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
// 	the most difficult part about this challenge was thinking what to make a Game of.
// What did you learn about creating objects and functions that interact with one another?
// 	 I used a function that both goodguy and badguy are going to use and that is looseHealth, scince both of them are going to use this function it works out perfect.
// Did you learn about any new built-in methods you could use in your refactored solution? If so, what were they and how do they work?
// 	I didnt finish my game so I didnt refactored my solution.
// How can you access and manipulate properties of objects?
// 	I used the constructor fuction which is like a class for ruby.
