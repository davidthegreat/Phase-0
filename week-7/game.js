// Refactored Code






// Reflection
//What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
	the most difficult part about this challenge was thinking what to make a Game of.
What did you learn about creating objects and functions that interact with one another?
Did you learn about any new built-in methods you could use in your refactored solution? If so, what were they and how do they work?
How can you access and manipulate properties of objects?
